# Run when new Atom is launched:

# Prevent ctrl-c if the selection is empty:
atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor', 'core:copy', (e) ->
  editor = e.currentTarget.getModel()

  # do nothing if there's more than 1 selection
  return if editor.getSelectedBufferRanges().length > 1

  # get the starting and ending points of the selection
  {start, end} = editor.getSelectedBufferRange()

  # stop the command from immediate propagation (i.e.
  # executing the same command on the same element or
  # an element higher up the DOM tree). This works
  # because atom executes commands in the reverse order
  # they were registered with atom.commands.add, and this
  # one's added after the core commands are already registered.
  if start.column is end.column and start.row is end.row
